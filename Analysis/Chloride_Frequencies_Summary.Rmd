# Introduction
The Long Creek Watershed, almost three and a half square miles in area, is
dominated by commercial land use. The Maine Mall is one of the largest 
landowners in the watershed, and it is surrounded by a range of commercial
businesses, from medical offices, to car washes.  About a third of the watershed
is impervious surfaces like roads, parking lots, and rooftops.

Landowners with an acre or more of impervious area are required to get a Clean
Water Act permit for stormwater discharges from their property.  The LCWMD
provides an alternative for landowners to working to receive an individual
permit. Landowners who elect to participate in the The Long Creek Watershed
Management District receive a General Permit, in return for providing funding to
the District, and facilitating the work of the district by permitting access to
their property for certain activities.

For more information on LCWMD, see [their web site](restorelongcreek.org).

Over the past decade, LCWMD has contracted with several consulting firms to
provide  water quality monitoring services along Long Creek.  This has produced
one of the most extensive and best documented data set from the Northeastern US 
looking at water quality conditions in an urban stream.

GZA Geoenvironmental Incorporated (GZA) has been the primary monitoring
contractor for LCWMD for several years, and in 2019, they conducted a thorough
review of LCWMD data. These analyses are based on their summary data sets, and
recapitulate and extend their analyses.

## Are Water Quality Criteria Met?
The primary question we ask in this Notebook, is whether water quality criteria 
pertaining to levels of chloride are met. In particular, we explore
various ways of modeling those probabilities

We ask whether the probability of failing to meet criteria each day is
changing.  Secondarily, we examine differences among sites in the probability of
failing criteria.

In this data set a "TRUE" value consistently implies that water quality criteria
were met or exceeded, whether that is achieved by a value higher than or lower
than some numeric criteria.  "TRUE" implies good conditions.  "FALSE" implies 
bad conditions.
    
## Sources of Threshold Values  
### Chloride
Maine uses established thresholds for both chronic and acute exposure to
chloride. These are the “CCC and CMC” standards for chloride in freshwater.
(06-096 CMR 584). These terms are defined in a footnote as follows:

>   The Criteria Maximum Concentration (CMC) is an estimate of the highest
    concentration of a material in surface water to which an aquatic community
    can be exposed briefly without resulting in an unacceptable effect. The
    Criterion Continuous Concentration (CCC) is an estimate of the highest
    concentration of a material in surface water to which an aquatic community
    can be exposed indefinitely without resulting in an unacceptable effect.

The relevant thresholds are:

*   Chloride CCC  = 230  mg/l
*   Chloride CMC  = 860  mg/l

In practice, chloride in Long Creek are indirectly estimated based on 
measurement of conductivity.  The chloride-conductivity correlations is fairly
close and robust, but estimation is an additional source of error, although 
generally on the level of 10% or less.

Further, exceedances of the acute chloride threshold, the "CMC" are relatively 
rare, which limits ability to construct robust models. The classification tree 
models in "Classification_Tree_Models_Summary.Rmd" are perhaps more successful.

```

## Data on Sites and Impervious Cover
These data were derived from Table 2 from a GZA report to the Long Creek
Watershed Management District, titled "Re: Long Creek Watershed Data Analysis;
Task 2: Preparation of Explanatory and Other Variables."  The Memo is dated
November 13, 2019 File No. 09.0025977.02.

Cumulative Area and IC calculations are our own, based on the GZA data and the
geometry of the stream channel.

```{r IC_data}
# Read in data and drop the East Branch, where we have no data
fn <- "Site_IC_Data.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

Site_IC_Data <- read_csv(fpath) %>%
  filter(Site != "--") 

# Now, create a factor that preserves the order of rows (roughly upstream to downstream). 
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels = Site_IC_Data$Site))

# Finally, convert percent covers to numeric values
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(CumPctIC = as.numeric(substr(CumPctIC, 1, nchar(CumPctIC)-1))) %>%
  mutate(PctIC = as.numeric(substr(PctIC, 1, nchar(PctIC)-1)))
Site_IC_Data
```

## Main Data
We removed the  2019 data, as we don't have a complete year's worth of data, 
which may bias annual summaries.

Note that this data does *not* include all of the predictors used in some models
looking at chlorides. In particular, it does not include stream flow estimates. 

```{r main_data}
fn <- "Exceeds_Data.csv"
exceeds = read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn), progress=FALSE) %>%
  mutate(IC=Site_IC_Data$CumPctIC[match(Site, Site_IC_Data$Site)]) %>%
  filter(Year < 2019) %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels=levels(Site_IC_Data$Site)),
         year_f = factor(Year),
         month_f = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(sdate, format = '%j')),
         season = cut(Month, breaks = c(0,2,5,8,11,13),
                      labels = c('Winter', 'Spring',
                                 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter')),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Winter', 'Spring', 
                                           'Summer', 'Fall'))) %>%
  mutate(lPrecip = log1p(Precip))
```

## Data Corrections
### Anomalous Depth Values
Several depth observations in the record appear highly unlikely. In particular,
several observations show daily median water depths over 15 meters. A few other
observations show daily median depths over 4 meters, which also looks unlikely
in a stream of this size.  All these events also occurred in May or June of 2015
at site S05. Some sort of malfunction of the pressure transducer appears likely.

We can trace these observations back to the raw QA/QC'd pressure and sonde data 
submitted to LCWMD by GZA, so they are not an artifact of our data preparation.

We remove these extreme values.  The other daily medians in May and June of 2015
appear reasonable, and we leave them in place, although given possible 
instability of the pressure sensors, it might make sense to remove them all.

Note that removing depth observations from Site S05  will remove those dates
from any model that uses the `FlowIndex` variable (see below) as a predictor.

```{r correct_depth_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(D_Median = if_else(D_Median > 4, NA_real_, D_Median),
         lD_Median = log1p(D_Median))
```

### Single S06B Chloride Observation from 2017
The data includes just a single chloride observation from site S06B from
any year other than 2013.  While we do not know if the data point is legitimate
or not, it has  high leverage in several models, and we suspect a 
transcription error of some sort.

We remove the Chloride value from the data.
```{r correct_chloride_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(ChlCCC = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA, ChlCCC),
         ChlCMC = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA, ChlCMC))
```

### Anomalous Dissolved Oxygen and Chloride Values
We noted  extreme dissolved oxygen data at Site S03, during the end of 2016.
Values were both extreme and highly variable. (See discussion in the DO 
Analysis workbooks). We decided we should remove both the chloride and oxygen
observations after October 15th.

```{r correct_S03_October_2016_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>% 
  mutate(ChlCCC = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ChlCCC),
         ChlCMC = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ChlCMC))
```

## Remove Partial Data from Winter Months
We have very limited data from several months.  We have January data 
from only one year, and February data from only two, and December data from only
four years, all older.  Both March and November sample sizes vary.

The limited winter data generates severely unbalanced samples, which may lead to estimation problems, especially in models with crossed or potentially crossed
factors and predictors.  More fundamentally, the potential bias introduced by
showing data from those months from just a handful of years could give a
misleading impression of seasonal patterns.  We trim December, January and
February data, but leave the other months. 

It is important to remember,  even after trimming the data, that:  
1.  2010 is a partial year,  
2.  The period of sampling in March may be biased due to spring melt timing.

```{r month_by_year_crosstab}
xtabs(~ year_f + month_f, data = exceeds)
```

```{r remove_limited_winter_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  filter(Month >= 3 & Month <= 11)
```

## Add Stream Flow Index
We worked through many models on a site by site basis in which we included data
on water depth, but since the depth coordinate is site-specific, a 10 cm depth
at one site may be exceptional, while at another it is commonplace. We generally
want not a local measure of stream depth, but a watershed-wide metric of high,
medium, or low stream flow.

Middle and Lower Maine Stem sites would be suitable for a general flow indicator
across the watershed. The monitoring sites in that stretch of Long Creek include
include S05 and S17, however only site S05 has been in continuous operation
throughout the period of record, so we use depth data from S05 to construct
our general stream flow indicator.

Stream flow at S05 is correlated with flow at other sites, although not all that
closely correlated to flow in the downstream tributaries (S01 and S03).

```{r flow_correlations}
exceeds %>%
  select(sdate, Site, lD_Median) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Site, values_from = lD_Median) %>%
  select( -sdate) %>%
  cor(use = 'pairwise', method = 'pearson')
```

We use the log of the daily median flow at S05 as a general watershed-wide
stream flow indicator, which we call `FlowIndex`.  We use the log of the raw
median, to lessen the effect of the highly skewed distribution of stream depths
on the metric.

```{r add_FlowIndex}
depth_data <- exceeds %>%
  filter (Site == 'S05') %>%
  select(sdate, lD_Median)

exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(FlowIndex = depth_data$lD_Median[match(sdate, depth_data$sdate)])

rm(depth_data)
```

## Remove Site S06B, Trim Data
Site S06B only has chloride data from a single year, so including it in temporal
models causes problems.  We remove the Site from further analysis. We also
drop variables we will not analyze further in this Notebook.

```{r remove_S06B}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  filter(Site != 'S06B') %>%
  select(-starts_with('Class')) %>%
  select(-contains('T_ex')) %>%
  mutate(Site = droplevels(Site))
```

# Exploratory Cross Tabs
## Utility Function
This function just adds a percent summary column to a cross-tab.
```{r utility_fxn}
xt_pct <- function(.form, .dat) {
  xt <- xtabs(.form, data = .dat)
  xt <- cbind(xt, round(apply(xt, 1, function(X) X[1]/sum(X)), 3)*100)
  names(xt[3]) <- 'Percent Fail'
  return(xt)
}
```

## Chloride Chronic
```{r year_ccc_xtAB}
xt_pct(~Year + ChlCCC, exceeds)
```

But the Strong pattern is by sites.

```{r site_ccc_xtab}
xt_pct(~Site + ChlCCC, exceeds)
```

## Chloride Acute
```{r year_cmc_xtab}
xt_pct(~Year + ChlCMC, exceeds)
```

```{r site_cmc_xtab}
xt_pct(~Site + ChlCMC, exceeds)
```

Note that those probabilities are very low -- under 1% -- which is likely to 
limit ability to fit models to these data.

# Exploratory Graphics 
These are estimated as empirical relative frequencies, with error estimated 
as two times the standard error of the estimate.
```{r Site_exploratory_graphic}
exceeds %>%
  group_by(Site, Year) %>%
  summarize(CCC_true = sum(ChlCCC, na.rm = TRUE),
            CCC_count = sum(! is.na(ChlCCC)),
            CCC_p = CCC_true/CCC_count,
            CCC_err = CCC_p*(1-CCC_p)/sqrt(CCC_count),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, CCC_p, color = Site)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = CCC_p-2 * CCC_err, ymax = CCC_p + 2 * CCC_err)) +
  ylab('Probability of Passing\nChloride CCC Standard')
```

2016 was a rough year at most sites.  Sites S01 and S03 fail this standard
frequently.

Note that for some years at site S05, we never had a failure to meet this 
chloride standard.  This will probably further limit the models we can fit.

```{r month_exploritory_graphic}
exceeds  %>%
  group_by(month_f, Year) %>%
  summarize(CCC_true = sum(ChlCCC, na.rm = TRUE),
            CCC_count = sum(! is.na(ChlCCC)),
            CCC_p = CCC_true/CCC_count,
            CCC_err = CCC_p*(1-CCC_p)/sqrt(CCC_count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, CCC_p, color = month_f)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = CCC_p-2 * CCC_err, ymax = CCC_p + 2 * CCC_err))
```

That shows that 2011 and 2016 were fairly bad years.  But the month to month
patterns are less obvious than the year to year patterns  This highlights the 
role of relativity slow-dynamic processes (drought? groundwater flow?) in 
shaping chloride conditions in Long Creek.

# GAMM models
Fitting full GAMM models proves to be problematic, as models took a long time
to fit.  The big slow down is the correlation structure.  It speeds things 
slightly to subdivide the sections in which we expect the `corAR1()` to apply.

We need to include either a smoothed term or a random factor in the model to use
GAMM, even with a correlation term.  That is problematic, as none of our
predictors are good candidates for random factors. Sites could be considered a
random selection from all possible sites, or Year could be considered a random
selection from all possible years, but we are interested in estimates of year by
year and site by site differences.

We replace actual dates with sequential integers, simplifying model fitting.
Although R `Date` objects are integers under the hood, limiting possible values
to a smaller range was essential for fitting models with `glmmTMB()`, and it
appears to speed model fitting. We make the transformation via factors (which
are also integers under the hood).

```{r create_time_variable}
first_date <- min(exceeds$sdate)
last_date <- max(exceeds$sdate)

exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(sdate_f = factor(as.numeric(sdate), 
                          levels = as.numeric(first_date):as.numeric(last_date),
         labels = as.character(seq(from = first_date,
                                       to = last_date,
                                       by = 1))))
```

## Model Sequence
### Largest Model: Site, year_f, month_f, and FlowIndex
We start with a fairly large model, and wait for it to complete.  This took
slightly more than an hour and a half (5500 seconds) of computational time, as
shown by `system.time()`, but the code took over two hours to actually run.

The code saves the model once it runs, but the model is not included in the
GitHub repository.  The code does not detect changes in the underlying data, so
users need to delete the models by hand if they need to be run again on new
data.

```{r gamm_1, cache = TRUE}
if (! file.exists("models/ccc_gamm_1.rds")) {
  print(system.time(
    ccc_gamm_1<- gamm(ChlCCC ~ Site + year_f + month_f + s(FlowIndex),
                      correlation = corAR1(form = ~ as.numeric(sdate_f) | Site),
                      family = 'binomial',
                      niterPQL = 20,
                      data = exceeds)
  ))
  saveRDS(ccc_gamm_1, file="models/ccc_gamm_1.rds")
} else {
  ccc_gamm_1 <- readRDS("models/ccc_gamm_1.rds")
}
```

Marginal means from that model are likely to suffer from the Hauck-Donner 
effect, since many cells in the model structure never fail water quality
criteria.  Estimation from this model is therefore probably pointless, but it 
can act as the largest model in a hierarchical model sequence.

### Model 2:  Site, Year, and FlowIndex
A model that omits the Month term also takes some time to fit. Marginal means
from this model are potentially informative (if fit at median watershed flows).
We are almost certainly misrepresenting the behavior of Site S03 in this model.
Site S03 appears to be doing something quite different from the other sites, so 
we should consider omitting `Site == S03` from models entirely, but we  do not 
do so here.

This model takes not quite as long to fit, but you'll  want to go do something 
else for a while while this code runs. It takes a bit over an hour to run.

```{r gamm_2, cache = TRUE}
if (! file.exists("models/ccc_gamm_2.rds")) {
  print(system.time(
    ccc_gamm_2<- gamm(ChlCCC ~ Site + year_f + s(FlowIndex),
                      correlation = corAR1(form = ~ as.numeric(sdate_f) | Site),
                      family = 'binomial',
                      niterPQL = 20,
                      data = exceeds)
  ))
  saveRDS(ccc_gamm_2, file="models/ccc_gamm_2.rds")
} else {
  ccc_gamm_2 <- readRDS("models/ccc_gamm_2.rds")
}
```

In order to fit a model without the flow terms, we need to select one of our
other predictors to treat as a random factor.  We see substantial differences
in probability of failing these standards by Site, so we try some models that
treat `year_f` as a random factor.  You could fit a random factor two
ways, using the `random = ....` function parameter, or by including a 
random effects smooth term via `s(..., type = 're')`.

### Model 3: Site and Year
```{r gamm_3, cache = TRUE}
if (! file.exists("models/ccc_gamm_3.rds")) {
  print(system.time(
    ccc_gamm_3<- gamm(ChlCCC ~ Site + Year, random = list(year_f = ~ 1),
                      correlation = corAR1(form = ~ as.numeric(sdate_f) | Site),
                      family = 'binomial',
                      niterPQL = 20, verbosePQL = TRUE,
                      data = exceeds)
  ))
  saveRDS(ccc_gamm_3, file="models/ccc_gamm_3.rds")
} else {
  ccc_gamm_3 <- readRDS("models/ccc_gamm_3.rds")
}
```

### Model 4: Site Only
```{r gamm_4, cache = TRUE}
if (! file.exists("models/ccc_gamm_4.rds")) {
  print(system.time(
    ccc_gamm_4<- gamm(ChlCCC ~ Site, random = list(year_f = ~ 1),
                      correlation = corAR1(form = ~ as.numeric(sdate_f) | Site),
                      family = 'binomial',
                      niterPQL = 20,
                      data = exceeds)
  ))
  saveRDS(ccc_gamm_4, file="models/ccc_gamm_4.rds")
} else {
  ccc_gamm_4 <- readRDS("models/ccc_gamm_4.rds")
}
```

### Model 5: Month Only
```{r gamm_5, cache = TRUE}
if (! file.exists("models/ccc_gamm_5.rds")) {
  print(system.time(
    ccc_gamm_5<- gamm(ChlCCC ~ Site + month_f, random = list(year_f = ~ 1),
                      correlation = corAR1(form = ~ as.numeric(sdate_f) | Site),
                      family = 'binomial',
                      niterPQL = 20,
                      data = exceeds)
  ))
  saveRDS(ccc_gamm_5, file="models/ccc_gamm_5.rds")
} else {
  ccc_gamm_5 <- readRDS("models/ccc_gamm_5.rds")
}
```

# Examine Full Model
```{r}
anova(ccc_gamm_1$gam)
```

All model terms appear important,  Both Month and Year are fit with factors, 
which detects variation, but makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions.
(But see below for consideration of whether there is a long-term trend or not).

```{r}
summary(ccc_gamm_1$gam)
```

Some sites and some years are just plain worse than others.  Chloride levels 
are less likely to meet threshold in the spring and more likely to later in the 
year.

Note that the model fits a fairly complex smoothed term -- with over six
effective degrees of freedom. A simpler model would capture most of the 
important detail.

```{r plot_gamm_1}
plot(ccc_gamm_1$gam)
```

```{r}
gam.check(ccc_gamm_1$gam)
```

So, model diagnostics are not obviously dreadful. (They should be interpreted 
carefully with GAMM models, as the deviance residuals can be misleading).

# Is there a long term trend?
Model three included a linear year term and treated years as a random factor, 
thus effectively testing to see if there is a long term trend in probability of 
meeting chloride standards if we pool results by year.

```{r}
anova(ccc_gamm_3$gam)
```

So, when you consider the years as random variables, there is no long-term trend 
in probability to pass chlorides standards. Thus a long-term trend is present
(in the full model) but whether you consider it important or not depends on 
model specifications.

## By Site
```{r mm_by_site}
my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(ccc_gamm_1,  cov.reduce = median) 
a <- summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ Site, 
                      type = 'response'))

my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(ccc_gamm_2,  cov.reduce = median)
b <-  summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ Site,
                       type = 'response'))

my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(ccc_gamm_4,  cov.reduce = median) 
d <-  summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ Site, 
                       type = 'response'))

my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(ccc_gamm_5,  cov.reduce = median) 
e <-  summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ Site, 
                       type = 'response'))
```

```{r create_observed_probabilities}
observed <- exceeds %>%
  select(Site, ChlCCC) %>%
  group_by(Site) %>%
  summarize(Site = first(Site),
              n = sum(! is.na(ChlCCC)), 
              prob = mean(ChlCCC, na.rm = TRUE),
              SE = sqrt((prob * (1-prob))/n),
              lower.CL = prob - 1.96 * SE,
              upper.CL = prob + 1.96 * SE,
              .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r compare_models_by_site_1}
z <- tibble(Site = factor(levels(exceeds$Site), levels = levels(exceeds$Site)),
            observed = observed$prob, 
            mod_1 = a$prob, mod_2 = b$prob,
            mod_3 = c$prob, mod_4 = d$prob)


z %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Site, observed), names_to = 'Model', 
               values_to = 'Probability') %>%

  ggplot(aes(observed, Probability, color = Model)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = Model)) +
  annotate(geom = 'text', x = observed$prob,
           y = a$prob + .15, label = z$Site) +

  xlab("Observed Value") +
  ylab('Model Predictions (Adjusted)') +
  xlim(0,1) +
  ylim(0,1)
```

So all the models do  pretty good job predicting the observed values, except
at site S17, where predictions are consistently higher than what we observed,
presumably because the record for S17 is short, including only data from more
recent years.

```{r rm_z}
rm(z)
```

Models 1 and 3 generally provide nearly identical predictions, but
for all practical purposes, the four models are all saying the 
same thing.

We prefer models 1, for access to data on year by year and month by month
patterns, and model 4, for its simplicity.

             size = 3.5)
  

```

## By Year
Only Model 1 and Model 2 tracked Year as a Fixed Factor, so we only have two
models to compare. (Model 3 treated year as a regressor and random factor).

```{r create_year_mms}
my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(ccc_gamm_1,  cov.reduce = median) 
a <- summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ year_f, type = 'response'))

my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(ccc_gamm_2,  cov.reduce = median) 
b <- summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ year_f, type = 'response'))
```

```{r create_observed_p_df}  
observed <- exceeds %>%
  select(year_f, ChlCCC) %>%
  group_by(year_f) %>%
  summarize(year_f = first(year_f),
              n = sum(! is.na(ChlCCC)), 
              prob = mean(ChlCCC, na.rm = TRUE),
              SE = sqrt((prob * (1-prob))/n),
              lower.CL = prob - 1.96 * SE,
              upper.CL = prob + 1.96 * SE,
              .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r create_plotting_df}
z <- tibble(Year = factor(levels(exceeds$year_f), 
                          levels = levels(exceeds$year_f)),
            observed = observed$prob, 
            mod_1 = a$prob, mod_2 = b$prob )

z %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Year, observed), names_to = 'Model', 
               values_to = 'Probability') %>%

  ggplot(aes(observed, Probability, color = Model)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = Model)) +
  annotate(geom = 'text', x = observed$prob,
           y = a$prob + .15, label = z$Year) +
  
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, lty = 3) +
  xlab("Observed Value") +
  ylab('Model Predictions (Adjusted)') +
  xlim(0,1) +
  ylim(0,1)
```

Here our marginal means do not show up so well.  The model predictions are
highly correlated, but neither model does very well reproducing observed
frequencies, at least for 2010 and 2012. 2010 is a year with no data from the
early part of the year, so marginal means from either model are biased. It's not
clear why estimates from 2012 are also on the high side.

## By Month
Only Model 5 is fit with the `month_f` term.  When we included other predictors, 
along with thE month, we ran into problems fitting the model.

```{r}
my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(ccc_gamm_1,  cov.reduce = median) 
a <- summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ month_f, type = 'response'))

my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(ccc_gamm_5,  cov.reduce = median) 
b <- summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ month_f, type = 'response'))

observed <- exceeds %>%
  select(month_f, ChlCCC) %>%
  group_by(month_f) %>%
  summarize(month_f = first(month_f),
              n = sum(! is.na(ChlCCC)), 
              prob = mean(ChlCCC, na.rm = TRUE),
              SE = sqrt((prob * (1-prob))/n),
              lower.CL = prob - 1.96 * SE,
              upper.CL = prob + 1.96 * SE,
              .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r}
 z <- tibble(Month = factor(month.abb[3:11], levels = month.abb),
             observed = observed$prob, 
             mod_1 = a$prob, 
             mod_5 = b$prob )
```

```{r}
z %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Month, observed), names_to = 'Model',
               values_to = 'Probability') %>%
  arrange(Model, Month) %>%

  ggplot(aes(observed, Probability, color = Model)) +

  geom_segment(aes(xend=c(tail(observed, n= -1), NA),
                   yend=c(Probability[2:9], NA, Probability[11:18], NA)),
                   arrow=arrow(length=unit(0.075,"inches"), type = 'closed')) +
  geom_text(aes(x = observed,
                y = Probability,
                label = Month)) +

  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, lty = 3) +
  xlab("Observed Value") +
  ylab('Model Predictions (Adjusted)') +
  xlim(0,.6) +
  ylim(0,.6)
```

There is a lot of scatter here.  The pattern is revealing.  Our "flow adjusted"
monthly values are lower in winter and higher in summer than the observed
values, while the simpler model without a flow term fits the observed values 
more closely.

This reflects the influence of flow on the marginal means. The usual low flow in
summer means "observed" levels generally co-occur with low flow, when we now
know chloride levels tend to be slightly higher, and thus probability of meeting
the chloride standards slightly lower. As the algorithm adjusts the estimated
probabilities to median flow (which is rare in the summer), it gives predictions
for summer flows at median stream flow -- which is a rare event.  The
predictions may be accurate, but they are not accurate regarding circumstances
we actually observe in the field .  Thus the "adjusted" marginal means are
slightly better than what we actually observed.
