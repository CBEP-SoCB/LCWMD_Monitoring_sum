# Introduction
The Long Creek Watershed, almost three and a half square miles in area, is
dominated by commercial land use. The Maine Mall is one of the largest land
owners in the watershed, and it is surrounded by a range of commercial
businesses, from medical offices, to car washes.  About a third of the watershed
in impervious surfaces like roads, parking lots, and rooftops.

Landowners with an acre or more of impervious area are required to get a Clean
Water Act permit for stormwater discharges from their property.  The LCWMD
provides an alternative for landowners to working to receive an individual
permit. Landowners who elect to participate in the The Long Creek Watershed
Management District receive a General Permit, in return for providing funding to
the District, and facilitating the work of the district by permitting access to
their property for certain activities.

For more information on LCWMD, see [their web site](restorelongcreek.org).

# This notebook
This notebook focuses on checking whether there is a statistically 
meaningful long-term trend in risk of low dissolved oxygen events in July and 
August.  The core challenge is that we have a limited number of 
years of data.  We believe that because of slow response of the watershed to
changes in precipitation, year to year variation is significant, and should
be modeled.

## Note
In this data set a "TRUE" value consistently implies that water quality criteria
were met or exceeded, whether that is achieved by a value higher than or lower
than some numeric criteria.  "TRUE" implies good conditions.  "FALSE" implies 
bad conditions.
    
## Sources of Threshold Values  
### Dissolved oxygen
Maineâ€™s Class B water quality standards call for dissolved oxygen above 7 mg/l,
with percent saturation above 75%. The Class C Standards, which apply to almost
all of Long Creek, call for dissolved oxygen above 5 mg/l, with percent
saturation above 60%. In addition, for class C conditions, the thirty day
average dissolved oxygen must stay above 6.5 mg/l.

```

## Data on Sites and Impervious Cover
These data were derived from Table 2 from a GZA report to the Long Creek
Watershed Management District, titled "Re: Long Creek Watershed Data Analysis;
Task 2: Preparation of Explanatory and Other Variables."  The Memo is dated
November 13, 2019 File No. 09.0025977.02.

Cumulative Area and IC calculations are our own, based on the GZA data and the
geometry of the stream channel.

```{r IC_data}
# Read in data and drop the East Branch, where we have no data
fn <- "Site_IC_Data.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

Site_IC_Data <- read_csv(fpath) %>%
  filter(Site != "--") 

# Now, create a factor that preserves the order of rows (roughly upstream to downstream). 
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels = Site_IC_Data$Site))

# Finally, convert percent covers to numeric values
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(CumPctIC = as.numeric(substr(CumPctIC, 1, nchar(CumPctIC)-1))) %>%
  mutate(PctIC = as.numeric(substr(PctIC, 1, nchar(PctIC)-1)))
Site_IC_Data
```

## Main Data
We remove 2019 data, as we don't have a complete year's worth of data, which may
bias annual summaries.

Note that this data does NOT include all of the predictors used in some models
looking at chlorides. In particular, it does not include stream flow estimates 
```{r main_data}
fn <- "Exceeds_Data.csv"
exceeds = read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn), progress=FALSE) %>%
  mutate(IC=Site_IC_Data$CumPctIC[match(Site, Site_IC_Data$Site)]) %>%
  select(-X1) %>%
  filter(Year < 2019) %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels=levels(Site_IC_Data$Site)),
         year_f = factor(Year),
         month_f = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(sdate, format = '%j')),
         season = cut(Month, breaks = c(0,2,5,8,11,13),
                      labels = c('Winter', 'Spring',
                                 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter')),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Winter', 'Spring', 
                                           'Summer', 'Fall'))) %>%
  mutate(lPrecip = log1p(Precip))
```

## Data Corrections
### Anomolous Depth Values
Several depth observations in the record appear highly unlikely. In particular,
several observations show daily median water depths over 15 meters. A few other
observations show daily median depths over 4 meters, which also looks unlikely
in a stream of this size.  All these events also occurred in May or June of 2015
at site S05. Some sort of malfunction of the pressure transducer appears likely.

We can trace these observations back to the raw QA/QC'd pressure and sonde data 
submitted to LCWMD by GZA, so they are not an artifact of our data preparation.

We remove these extreme values.  The other daily medians in May and June of 2015
appear reasonable, and we leave them in place, although given possible 
instability of the pressure sensors, it might make sense to remove them all.

Note that removing depth observations from Site S05  will remove those DATES
from any model that uses the `FlowIndex` variable (see below) as a predictor.
```{r correct_depth_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(D_Median = if_else(D_Median > 4, NA_real_, D_Median),
         lD_Median = log1p(D_Median))
```

### Single S06B Chloride Observation from 2017
The data includes just a single chloride observation from site S06B from
any year other than 2013.  While we do not know if the data point is legitimate
or not, it has  high leverage in several models, and we suspect a 
transcription error of some sort.

We remove the Chloride value from the data.
```{r correct_chloride_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(ChlCCC = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA, ChlCCC),
         ChlCMC = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA, ChlCMC))
```


### Anomolous Dissolved Oxygen and Chloride Values
#### Site S03, end of 2016
We noted  extreme dissolved oxygen data at the end of 2016.  Values were
both extreme and highly variable.  (See discussion in the DO Analysis workbooks).

We decide we should remove chloride and oxygen observations after October 15th.

```{r correct_S03_October_2016_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>% 
  mutate(ChlCCC = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ChlCCC),
         ChlCMC = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ChlCMC),
         ClassCDO = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassCDO),
         ClassBDO = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassBDO),
         ClassC_PctSat = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassC_PctSat),
         ClassB_PctSat = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassB_PctSat),
         ClassCBoth = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassCBoth),
         ClassBBoth = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassBBoth))
```

## Remove Partial Data from Winter Months
We have very limited data from several months.  We have January data 
from only one year, and February data from only two, and December data from only
four years, all older.  Both March and November sample sizes vary.

The limited winter data generates severely unbalanced samples, which may lead to estimation problems, especially in models with crossed or potentially crossed
factors and predictors.  More fundamentally, the potential bias introduced by
showing data from those months from just a handful of years could give a
misleading impression of seasonal patterns.  We trim December, January and
February data, but leave the other months. 

It is important to remember,  even after trimming the data, that:  
1.  2010 is a partial year,  
2.  The period of sampling in March may be biased due to spring melt timing.

```{r month_by_year_crosstab}
xtabs(~ year_f + month_f, data = exceeds)
```

```{r remove_limited_winter_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  filter(Month >= 3 & Month <= 11)
```

## Add Stream Flow Index
We worked through many models on a site by site basis in which we included data
on water depth, but since the depth coordinate is site-specific, a 10 cm depth
at one site may be exceptional, while at another it is commonplace. We generally
want not a local measure of stream depth, but a watershed-wide metric of high,
medium, or low stream flow.

Middle and Lower Main Stem sites would be suitable for a general flow indicator
across the watershed. The monitoring sites in that stretch of Long Creek include
include S05 and S17, however only site S05 has been in continuous operation
throughout the period of record, so we use depth data from S05 to construct
our general stream flow indicator.

Stream flow at S05 is correlated with flow at other sites, although not all that
closely correlated to flow in the downstream tributaries (S01 and S03).
```{r depth_correlations}
exceeds %>%
  select(sdate, Site, lD_Median) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Site, values_from = lD_Median) %>%
  select( -sdate) %>%
  cor(use = 'pairwise', method = 'pearson')

```
We use the log of the daily median flow at S05 as a general watershed-wide
stream flow indicator, which we call `FlowIndex`.  We use the log of the raw
median, to lessen the effect of the highly skewed distribution of stream depths
on the metric. The resulting index is still highly skewed.

```{r FlowIndex}
depth_data <- exceeds %>%
  filter (Site == 'S05') %>%
  select(sdate, lD_Median)

exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(FlowIndex = depth_data$lD_Median[match(sdate, depth_data$sdate)])

rm(depth_data)
```

## Create July and August Data Only
```{r filter_July_August}
exceeds_two <- exceeds %>%
  filter(Month  > 6 & Month < 9)
rm(exceeds)
```

# GAMM Models with Autocorrelated Error
## Model 1:  Site by Year Interaction With Covariates
```{r do_gamm_trend_1, cache = TRUE}
    do_gamm_two_trend_1<- gamm(ClassCDO ~ Site * Year + MaxT + 
                         s(lPrecip), random = list(year_f = ~ 1),
                       correlation = corCAR1(form = ~ sdate | Site),
                       family = 'binomial',
                       niterPQL = 20, verbosePQL = TRUE,
                       data = exceeds_two)
```

```{r}
anova(do_gamm_two_trend_1$gam)
```
Note that in this model, neither the Year term nor the the Site by Year 
interaction terms achieve statistical significance.

## Model 2:  Both Linear and Random Year Terms, No Interaction
we add a random term for the years.  This is problematic, since we are also fitting year by
year model coefficients, so any trend will be parceled out between the linear
term and a residual
```{r do_gamm_trend_2, cache = TRUE}
do_gamm_two_trend_2<- gamm(ClassCDO ~ Site + Year + MaxT + 
                             s(lPrecip), random = list(year_f = ~ 1),
                           correlation = corCAR1(form = ~ sdate | Site),
                           family = 'binomial',
                           niterPQL = 20, verbosePQL = TRUE,
                           data = exceeds_two)
```

```{r}
anova(do_gamm_two_trend_2$gam)
```
Once we drop the interaction terms, the Year term emerges as statistically 
significant.

## Model 3:  Both Linear and Random Terms Without Temperature
Finally, we fit a model without the temperature term.
```{r do_gamm_trend_3, cache = TRUE}
do_gamm_two_trend_3<- gamm(ClassCDO ~ Site +Year + 
                             s(lPrecip), random = list(year_f = ~ 1),
                           correlation = corCAR1(form = ~ sdate | Site),
                           family = 'binomial',
                           niterPQL = 20, verbosePQL = TRUE,
                           data = exceeds_two)
```

```{r}
anova(do_gamm_two_trend_3$gam)
```

Under this models, the Year linear trend is still significant.

## Model 4:  Site and Year, Alone
The interaction between site and year is NOT significant (model not shown).
```{r do_gamm_trend_4, cache = TRUE}
do_gamm_two_trend_4<- gamm(ClassCDO ~ Site + Year, 
                           random = list(year_f = ~ 1),
                           correlation = corCAR1(form = ~ sdate | Site),
                           family = 'binomial',
                           niterPQL = 20, verbosePQL = TRUE,
                           data = exceeds_two)
```


```{r}
anova(do_gamm_two_trend_4$gam, test = 'Chisq')
```

# Extract Marginal Means From Model 2
```{r do_construct_call}
the_call <-  quote(gamm(ClassCDO ~ Site + Year + MaxT + 
                        s(lPrecip),
                        random = list(year_f = ~ 1),
                        correlation = corCAR1(form = ~ sdate | Site),
                        family = 'binomial',
                        niterPQL = 20, verbosePQL = TRUE,
                        data = exceeds_two))
do_gamm_two_trend_2$gam$call <- the_call
```

## By Site
```{r do_m2_mm_by_site}
my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(do_gamm_two_trend_2,  cov.reduce = median) 
(b <- emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ Site, type = 'response'))
```

Note that the confidence intervals don't all overlap. Downstream sites have
lower risk.

### Graphics
```{r do_m2_mm_graphic_by_site, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3}
s <- summary(b)

ggplot(s, aes(Site, prob)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL),
                color = cbep_colors()[1]) +
  
  ylab('Probability of Passing\nClass C DO Standard') +
  xlab('     Upstream        Main Stem       Downstream') +
  ggtitle('July and August Only') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10))
```
Probabilities and 95% confidence intervals.  These intervals are wider because
we treat year to year variation as important and independent of other sources
of uncertainty.  That makes fewer contrasts between sites statistically robust.
Basically, the only meaningful differences are between the downstream
tributaries, with low risk of low dissolved oxygen, and (many of) the other 
sites.
```{r}
pwpp(my_ref_grid)
```

## By Year
Since this prediction is capturing a simple linear term in the underlying GAM,
it is not very informative without overlaying it over real data.  But note the
wide overlap of confidence intervals. Although the trend is significant,
predictions year to year overlap.
```{r do_mm_by_years}
my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(do_gamm_two_trend_2, cov.keep = 'Year', cov.reduce = median) 
(b <- emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ Year, type = 'response'))

```

### Graphics
```{r do_mm_graphic_by_years, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3}
s <- summary(b)

ggplot(s, aes(Year, prob)) +
 
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL),
                color = cbep_colors()[1]) +
  geom_line(color = cbep_colors()[3]) +
  
  ylab('Probability of Passing\nClass C DO Standard') +
  xlab('') +
  ggtitle('July and August Only') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)
```

Those confidence intervals reflect the mathematics of the GLM. Errors are wider
with  $p \approx  0.50 $, and asymmetric near the limits $p = 1.0$ or $p = 0.0$.
