# Introduction

## Are Water Quality Criteria Met?

The primary question we ask in this Notebook, is whether water quality
criteria are met. In particular, we explore classification tree models
to gain insight into the mechanisms likely to drive water quality
problems.

In this data set a “TRUE” value consistently implies that water quality
criteria were met or exceeded, whether that is achieved by a value
higher than or lower than some numeric criteria. “TRUE” implies good
conditions. “FALSE” implies bad conditions.

We explore classification tree models that look for partitions of the
data that do a good job predicting whether water quality criteria are
met, based on splitting the data into groups based on values of
predictor variables. These models naturally handle complex interactions,
and can provide insight into dominant patterns in the data.

Many of the loosely phrased explanations of patterns found in the Long
Creek data can be traced back, in part, to the insights generated by
these classification models.

## Sources of Threshold Values

### Dissolved oxygen

Maine’s Class B water quality standards call for dissolved oxygen above
7 mg/l, with percent saturation above 75%. The Class C Standards, which
apply to almost all of Long Creek, call for dissolved oxygen above 5
mg/l, with percent saturation above 60%. In addition, for class C
conditions, the thirty day average dissolved oxygen must stay above 6.5
mg/l.

### Chloride

Maine uses established thresholds for both chronic and acute exposure to
chloride. These are the “CCC and CMC” standards for chloride in
freshwater. (06-096 CMR 584). These terms are defined in a footnote as
follows:

> The Criteria Maximum Concentration (CMC) is an estimate of the highest
> concentration of a material in surface water to which an aquatic
> community can be exposed briefly without resulting in an unacceptable
> effect. The Criterion Continuous Concentration (CCC) is an estimate of
> the highest concentration of a material in surface water to which an
> aquatic community can be exposed indefinitely without resulting in an
> unacceptable effect.

The relevant thresholds are:

-   Chloride CCC = 230 mg/l
-   Chloride CMC = 860 mg/l

In practice, chloride in Long Creek are indirectly estimated based on
measurement of conductivity. The chloride-conductivity correlations is
fairly close and robust, but estimation is an additional source of
error, although generally on the level of 10% or less.

### Temperature

There are no legally binding Maine criteria for maximum stream
temperature, but we can back into thresholds based on research on
thermal tolerance of brook trout in streams. A study from Michigan and
Wisconsin, showed that trout are found in streams with daily mean water
temperatures as high as 25.3°C, but only if the period of exceedance of
that daily average temperature is short – only one day. Similarly, the
one day daily maximum temperature above which trout were never found was
27.6°C. That generates two temperature criteria, one for daily averages,
and one for daily maximums.

These criteria should be taken as rough values only, as the original
study was observational, and thus the key driver of suitability for
trout could be another stressor correlated with these temperature
metrics.

# Data Preparation

## Folder References

``` r
sibfldnm    <- 'Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
```

## Data on Sites and Impervious Cover

These data were derived from Table 2 from a GZA report to the Long Creek
Watershed Management District, titled “Re: Long Creek Watershed Data
Analysis; Task 2: Preparation of Explanatory and Other Variables.” The
Memo is dated November 13, 2019 File No. 09.0025977.02.

Cumulative Area and IC calculations are our own, based on the GZA data
and the geometry of the stream channel.

``` r
# Read in data and drop the East Branch, where we have no data
fn <- "Site_IC_Data.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

Site_IC_Data <- read_csv(fpath) %>%
  filter(Site != "--")

#> 
#> i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
#> i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

# Now, create a factor that preserves the order of rows (roughly upstream to downstream). 
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels = Site_IC_Data$Site))

# Finally, convert percent covers to numeric values
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(CumPctIC = as.numeric(substr(CumPctIC, 1, nchar(CumPctIC)-1))) %>%

```

## Main Data

We remove 2019 data, as we don’t have a complete year’s worth of data,
which may bias annual summaries.

Note that this data does NOT include all of the predictors used in some
models looking at chlorides. In particular, it does not include stream
flow estimates.

``` r
fn <- "Exceeds_Data.csv"
exceeds = read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn), progress=FALSE) %>%
  mutate(IC=Site_IC_Data$CumPctIC[match(Site, Site_IC_Data$Site)]) %>%
  select(-...1) %>%
  filter(Year < 2019) %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels=levels(Site_IC_Data$Site))) %>%
  mutate(year_f = factor(Year),
         month_f = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb),
         season = cut(Month, breaks = c(0,2,5,8,11,13),
                      labels = c('Winter', 'Spring',
                                 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter')),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Winter', 'Spring', 
                                           'Summer', 'Fall'))) %>%

```

## Data Corrections

### Anomalous Depth Values

Several depth observations in the record appear highly unlikely. In
particular, several observations show daily median water depths over 15
meters. A few other observations show daily median depths over 4 meters,
which also looks unlikely in a stream of this size. All these events
also occurred in May or June of 2015 at site S05. Some sort of
malfunction of the pressure transducer appears likely.

We can trace these observations back to the raw QA/QC’d pressure and
sonde data submitted to LCWMD by GZA, so they are not an artifact of our
data preparation.

We remove these extreme values. The other daily medians in May and June
of 2015 appear reasonable, and we leave them in place, although given
possible instability of the pressure sensors, it might make sense to
remove them all.

Note that removing depth observations from Site S05 will remove those
dates from any model that uses the `FlowIndex` variable (see below) as a
predictor.

``` r
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(D_Median = if_else(D_Median > 4, NA_real_, D_Median),
         lD_Median = log1p(D_Median))
```

### Single S06B Chloride Observation from 2017

The data includes just a single chloride observation from site S06B from
any year other than 2013. While we do not know if the data point is
legitimate or not, it has high leverage in several models, and we
suspect a transcription error of some sort.

We remove the Chloride value from the data.

``` r
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(ChlCCC = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA, ChlCCC),
         ChlCMC = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA, ChlCMC))
```

## Add Stream Flow Index

We worked through many models on a site by site basis in which we
included data on water depth, but since the depth coordinate is
site-specific, a 10 cm depth at one site may be exceptional, while at
another it is commonplace. We generally want not a local measure of
stream depth, but a watershed-wide metric of high, medium, or low stream
flow.

Middle and Lower Maine Stem sites would be suitable for a general flow
indicator across the watershed. The monitoring sites in that stretch of
Long Creek include include S05 and S17, however only site S05 has been
in continuous operation throughout the period of record, so we use depth
data from S05 to construct our general stream flow indicator.

Stream flow at S05 is correlated with flow at other sites, although not
all that closely correlated to flow in the downstream tributaries (S01
and S03).

``` r
exceeds %>%
  select(sdate, Site, lD_Median) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Site, values_from = lD_Median) %>%
  select( -sdate) %>%
  cor(use = 'pairwise', method = 'pearson')
#>            S01       S03       S05      S06B       S07       S17
#> S01  1.0000000 0.4441852 0.6668570 0.6310361 0.5859663 0.7290077
#> S03  0.4441852 1.0000000 0.4250331 0.7152403 0.4434108 0.6666414
#> S05  0.6668570 0.4250331 1.0000000 0.8043943 0.7177120 0.7906571
#> S06B 0.6310361 0.7152403 0.8043943 1.0000000 0.5882527 0.8778188
#> S07  0.5859663 0.4434108 0.7177120 0.5882527 1.0000000 0.7327432
#> S17  0.7290077 0.6666414 0.7906571 0.8778188 0.7327432 1.0000000
```

We use the log of the daily median flow at S05 as a general
watershed-wide stream flow indicator, which we call `FlowIndex`. We use
the log of the raw median, to lessen the effect of the highly skewed
distribution of stream depths on the metric.

``` r
depth_data <- exceeds %>%
  filter (Site == 'S05') %>%
  select(sdate, lD_Median)

exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(FlowIndex = depth_data$lD_Median[match(sdate, depth_data$sdate)])

rm(depth_data)
```

# Days that Pass DO Standards

## Initial Model

Each of the tree models we prepared looking at dissolved oxygen are
based on predicting the probability of failing water quality standards,
not predicting absolute dissolved oxygen levels. This helps avoid
problems with data that is far from normally distributed, with rare
extreme low dissolved oxygen values.

``` r
do_tree <- rpart(ClassCDO ~ Site + year_f + MaxT + FlowIndex,
                 data = exceeds)
```

``` r
printcp(do_tree)
#> 
#> Regression tree:
#> rpart(formula = ClassCDO ~ Site + year_f + MaxT + FlowIndex, 
#>     data = exceeds)
#> 
#> Variables actually used in tree construction:
#> [1] FlowIndex MaxT      Site      year_f   
#> 
#> Root node error: 1101.2/8624 = 0.12769
#> 
#> n=8624 (2354 observations deleted due to missingness)
#> 
#>          CP nsplit rel error  xerror     xstd
#> 1  0.089504      0   1.00000 1.00037 0.021085
#> 2  0.084329      1   0.91050 0.92622 0.019779
#> 3  0.024114      2   0.82617 0.82903 0.019306
#> 4  0.022351      3   0.80205 0.81221 0.019541
#> 5  0.014269      5   0.75735 0.76095 0.018723
#> 6  0.013428      7   0.72881 0.74808 0.018715
#> 7  0.012959      9   0.70196 0.73127 0.018408
#> 8  0.010738     11   0.67604 0.69200 0.018138
#> 9  0.010369     12   0.66530 0.67574 0.018303
#> 10 0.010000     13   0.65493 0.67367 0.018313
```

These trees perform OK, with approximately 8.4 percent classification
error. The cross validation error does not flatten out, so there is
little evidence of significant overfitting here, but from an
interpretation perspective, the model is hard to summarize, so we do not
show a graphic of the classification tree.

``` r
plotcp(do_tree)
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/do_cp_2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
The relative error drops fairly linearly, so there is no great point to
break this tree as we prune.

If we prune the tree just slightly, it becomes more readily interpreted.

``` r
do_tree_prune <- prune(do_tree, 0.0125)
rpart.plot(do_tree_prune)
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/plot_do_tree_1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Or, pruned more aggressively

``` r
do_tree_prune_2 <- prune(do_tree, 0.0165)
rpart.plot(do_tree_prune_2)
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/plot_do_tree_2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
(We explored several related models, but the tree structure remained
dominated by the same factors, with similar interpretation, so we do not
show those alternate models).

## Conclusions

We can summarize the trees as follows:

In most years, probability of low dissolved oxygen is fairly low, around
.09. In those years, probability is highest (about 0.26) during low flow
conditions, especially at our upper watershed sites, where under low
flow, it was over 0.50.

In especially bad years, like 2016 and 2018, we saw about triple the
rate of failure to meet dissolved oxygen criteria (0.34). In those bad
years (which had low flow almost all summer), we nevertheless saw few
problems during days with cool weather. Upper watershed sites were
especially vulnerable during warm weather.

## Side Bar: Frequency of Watershed Low Flow

Overall, about one sixth of summer days qualify as “low flow” based on
the flow index. We can determine that by looking at frequency of low
flow at the index station we used to develop the flow index, and
determining how often is below the cutoff cutoff value (0.096 meters, or
about 10cm) derived from the tree model.

``` r
sum(exceeds$FlowIndex[exceeds$Site == 'S05'] < 0.096, na.rm = TRUE) /
  sum(! is.na(exceeds$FlowIndex[exceeds$Site == 'S05']))
#> [1] 0.154633
```

``` r
exceeds %>%
  filter(Site =='S05') %>%
  select(FlowIndex) %>%
  ggplot(aes(FlowIndex)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.096, lty = 3)
#> `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
#> Warning: Removed 285 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/flow_histogram-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Low Flow in the Upper Watershed

So the cut point is at about 15% lowest flow conditions. We can graph
the relationship between flow index and flow at the upper watershed,
specifically Blanchette Brook, to understand how low-flow conditions
upstream may relate to low flow conditions in the middle watershed.

``` r
exceeds %>%
  filter(Site =='S07', Month >5, Month < 10) %>%
  select(D_Median, FlowIndex, year_f) %>%
  ggplot(aes(FlowIndex, D_Median, color = year_f) ) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +
  #scale_y_log10() +
  xlab('Downstream Flow Index') +
  ylab('Blanchette Brook Flow')
#> `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'
#> Warning: Removed 370 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).
#> Warning: Removed 370 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/Blanchette_low_flow-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

-   Days of exceptionally low upper watershed flow are frequent in
    recent years.  
-   Almost all days with exceptionally low watershed flow are also
    exceptionally low flow days in the upper watershed.  
-   The converse is not true. 2012, in particular, recorded low water
    depths in the upper watershed coincided with days with high flow
    further downstream.  
-   Relationship between upper and lower watershed flow differs year to
    year.

Low flow conditions in Blanchette Brook were common in some years, less
so in other years.

``` r
exceeds %>%
  filter(Site =='S07', Month >5, Month < 10) %>%
  select(D_Median, Year, year_f) %>%
  group_by(year_f) %>%
  summarize(Year = first(Year),
            n = sum(! is.na(D_Median)),
            low = sum(D_Median < 0.1, na.rm = TRUE),
            pct = low/n,
            .groups = 'drop') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Year, pct) ) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab('Percent Days\nDepth < 10cm')
#> Warning: Removed 1 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path).
```

## DO Model Based on Local Water Depth

We might chose to develop a dissolved oxygen model that focuses on
*local* water depth rather than a stream-wide flow index. We develop
that model here to see

``` r
do_depth <- rpart(ClassCDO ~ Site + year_f + MaxT + D_Median,
                 data = exceeds)
```

``` r
printcp(do_depth)

Performance is similar to the prior model, with if anything a slightly
higher cross validation error, although with fewer steps evaluated.

``` r
plotcp(do_depth)
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/do_cp_4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Remember “True” means the site PASSES water quality criteria.

If we prune the tree just slightly, it becomes more readily interpreted.

``` r
do_depth_prune <- prune(do_depth, 0.018)
rpart.plot(do_depth_prune)
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/plot_do_depth-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This is remarkably similar to our previous DO model, except that water
depth replaces Site as a predictor.

So, in “good” years, water depth (or flow) is critical, while the worst
conditions in bad years are ameliorated by cool weather. Our worst
conditions occur during low flow, hot days.

# Days that Pass PctSat Standards

``` r
psat_tree <- rpart(ClassC_PctSat ~ Site + year_f + MaxT + FlowIndex,
                 data = exceeds)
```

``` r

These trees perform not quite as well as the DO trees. Classification
error is on the order of 12.2 percent classification error. The cross
validation error, however, flattens out fast, so a slightly simpler tree
will perform nearly as well.

``` r
plotcp(psat_tree)
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/psat_cp_2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Remember “True” means the site PASSES water quality criteria.

``` r
rpart.plot(psat_tree)
```

Here the first cut is low flow conditions, corresponding roughly to flow
below about one third of summer typical flow. The next cuts split out
especially bad years, and then our most at-risk sites. So, the overall
story remains the same, except that temperature is no longer an
important explanatory variable. Percent saturation is driven by low flow
conditions, “bad” years, and at risk, small tributary, upstream sites.

But note that days with flow low enough to put percent saturation at
risk are somewhat more common with about one third of days falling below
the threshold used in this model.

``` r
sum(exceeds$FlowIndex[exceeds$Site == 'S05'] < 0.16, na.rm = TRUE) /
  sum(! is.na(exceeds$FlowIndex[exceeds$Site == 'S05']))
#> [1] 0.3351384
```

# Days that Pass Chloride Standards

chl_tree <- rpart(ChlCCC ~ Site + year_f + MaxT + FlowIndex,

These trees perform still less well….

Classification error is on the order of 14.5 percent. Trimming may help,
but not as much as for PctSat.

``` r
plotcp(chl_tree)
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/chl_cp_2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Remember “True” means the site PASSES water quality criteria.

``` r
rpart.plot(chl_tree)
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/plot_chl_tree_CCC-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Here, location controls risk to a high degree. Just over a third of all
days at all sites passed the lower chloride (CCC) threshold. That
dropped to under a fifth at our most vulnerable sites, especially the
downstream tributaries (S01 and S03). 2016, 2017, and 2018 were bad
years, especially at our less vulnerable sites.

## CMC (Acute Exposure) Standard

``` r
chl_tree_2 <- rpart(ChlCMC ~ Site + year_f + MaxT + FlowIndex,
                 data = exceeds)

These trees perform very well. Classification error is on the order of
2.4 percent. There is little improvement in fit after the first three
splits, so we prune the tree.

``` r
plotcp(chl_tree_2)
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/chl_cp_4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
chl_tree_2 <- prune(chl_tree_2, 0.02)
```

Remember “True” means the site PASSES water quality criteria.

``` r
rpart.plot(chl_tree_2)
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/plot_chl_tre_CMC-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
This tree suggests violations of the more stringent chloride standards
almost never happened, except at site S01, and they were relatively rare
there except in our two worst years, under low flow conditions.

# Days that Meet Temperature Thresholds

## Acute Temperature Thresholds

temp_tree <- rpart(MaxT_ex ~ Site + year_f + MaxT + FlowIndex,

``` r
rpart.plot(temp_tree)
```

<img src="Classification_Tree_Models_Summary_files/figure-gfm/plot_temp_tree-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

That’s just too simple. What the tree tells us is that:  
\* Violations of the Acute threshold are exceptionally rare.  
\* Stream temperature extremes only happen on really hot days (with air
temperature above 34.2 degrees C, or about 90 degrees F).  
\* But even then, some years are worse than others.

It’s not worth exploring trees for the chronic temperature limit, as
daily mean temperatures above that threshold almost never happen.
