A Shapefile, "LC_Mon_Loc_Nov_2020"  was received by Curtis C. Bohlen via 
e-mail from staff at the Cumberland County Soil and Water Conservation 
District, which manages the LCWMD GIS data, in November of 2020. Bohlen
derived the GIS data present here (""LC_Main_Mon_Loc"from the previous 
shapefile by selecting "Tier 1" monitoring locations only.
