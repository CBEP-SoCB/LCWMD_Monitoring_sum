# Introduction
This notebook produces a final version of a graphic depicting the PROBABILITY of
meeting or failing to meet Class C DO standards at each Long Creek Monitoring
location.

We focus on the summer months of July and August, because seasonal variation in
probability of meeting DO standards is very large, and low probability of
failing DO standards at other times of year interfere with efficient estimation.

## Note
In this data set a "TRUE" value consistently implies that water quality criteria
were met or exceeded, whether that is achieved by a value higher than or lower
than some numeric criteria.  "TRUE" implies good conditions.  "FALSE" implies 
bad conditions.
    
## Sources of Threshold Values  
### Dissolved oxygen
Maineâ€™s Class B water quality standards call for dissolved oxygen above 7 mg/l,
with percent saturation above 75%. The Class C Standards, which apply to almost
all of Long Creek, call for dissolved oxygen above 5 mg/l, with percent
saturation above 60%. In addition, for class C conditions, the thirty day
average dissolved oxygen must stay above 6.5 mg/l.

# Data Preparation
## Folder References
```{r folders}
sibfldnm    <- 'Derived_Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'models'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Data on Sites and Impervious Cover
These data were derived from Table 2 from a GZA report to the Long Creek
Watershed Management District, titled "Re: Long Creek Watershed Data Analysis;
Task 2: Preparation of Explanatory and Other Variables."  The Memo is dated
November 13, 2019 File No. 09.0025977.02.

Cumulative Area and IC calculations are our own, based on the GZA data and the
geometry of the stream channel.

```{r IC_data}
# Read in data and drop the East Branch, where we have no data
fn <- "Site_IC_Data.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

Site_IC_Data <- read_csv(fpath) %>%
  filter(Site != "--") 

# Now, create a factor that preserves the order of rows (roughly upstream to downstream). 
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels = Site_IC_Data$Site))

# Finally, convert percent covers to numeric values
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(CumPctIC = as.numeric(substr(CumPctIC, 1, nchar(CumPctIC)-1))) %>%
  mutate(PctIC = as.numeric(substr(PctIC, 1, nchar(PctIC)-1)))
Site_IC_Data
```

## Main Data
We remove 2019 data, as we don't have a complete year's worth of data, which may
bias annual summaries.

Note that this data does NOT include all of the predictors used in some models
looking at chlorides. In particular, it does not include stream flow estimates 
```{r main_data}
fn <- "Exceeds_Data.csv"
exceeds = read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn), progress=FALSE) %>%
  mutate(IC=Site_IC_Data$CumPctIC[match(Site, Site_IC_Data$Site)]) %>%
  select(-...1) %>%
  filter(Year < 2019) %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels=levels(Site_IC_Data$Site)),
         year_f = factor(Year),
         month_f = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(sdate, format = '%j')),
         season = cut(Month, breaks = c(0,2,5,8,11,13),
                      labels = c('Winter', 'Spring',
                                 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter')),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Winter', 'Spring', 
                                           'Summer', 'Fall'))) %>%
  mutate(lPrecip = log1p(Precip))
```

## Data Corrections
### Anomolous Depth Values
Several depth observations in the record appear highly unlikely. In particular,
several observations show daily median water depths over 15 meters. A few other
observations show daily median depths over 4 meters, which also looks unlikely
in a stream of this size.  All these events also occurred in May or June of 2015
at site S05. Some sort of malfunction of the pressure transducer appears likely.

We can trace these observations back to the raw QA/QC'd pressure and sonde data 
submitted to LCWMD by GZA, so they are not an artifact of our data preparation.

We remove these extreme values.  The other daily medians in May and June of 2015
appear reasonable, and we leave them in place, although given possible 
instability of the pressure sensors, it might make sense to remove them all.

Note that removing depth observations from Site S05  will remove those DATES
from any model that uses the `FlowIndex` variable (see below) as a predictor.
```{r correct_depth_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(D_Median = if_else(D_Median > 4, NA_real_, D_Median),
         lD_Median = log1p(D_Median))
```

### Single S06B Chloride Observation from 2017
The data includes just a single chloride observation from site S06B from
any year other than 2013.  While we do not know if the data point is legitimate
or not, it has  high leverage in several models, and we suspect a 
transcription error of some sort.

We remove the Chloride value from the data.
```{r correct_chloride_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(ChlCCC = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA, ChlCCC),
         ChlCMC = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA, ChlCMC))
```


### Anomolous Dissolved Oxygen and Chloride Values
#### Site S03, end of 2016
We noted  extreme dissolved oxygen data at the end of 2016.  Values were
both extreme and highly variable.  (See discussion in the DO Analysis workbooks).

We decide we should remove chloride and oxygen observations after October 15th.

```{r correct_S03_October_2016_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>% 
  mutate(ChlCCC = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ChlCCC),
         ChlCMC = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ChlCMC),
         ClassCDO = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassCDO),
         ClassBDO = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassBDO),
         ClassC_PctSat = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassC_PctSat),
         ClassB_PctSat = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassB_PctSat),
         ClassCBoth = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassCBoth),
         ClassBBoth = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassBBoth))
```

## Create July and August Data Only
```{r filter_July_August}
exceeds_two <- exceeds %>%
  filter(Month  > 6 & Month < 9)
rm(exceeds)
```

# Model based Graphics
This generates a graphic with more honest error bars, because it properly 
incorporates autocorrelation and year to year variation.

#### Model Development
The following takes a moderate amount of time to run ( <5 minutes).
```{r do_gamm_site, cache = TRUE}
do_gamm_two_site<- gamm(ClassCDO ~ 0 + Site + s(year_f, bs = 're'),
                      correlation = corCAR1(form = ~ sdate | Site),
                      family = 'binomial',
                      niterPQL = 20, verbosePQL = TRUE,
                      data = exceeds_two)
```

```{r}
summary(do_gamm_two_site$gam)
```

#### Extract Marginal Means
```{r do_construct_call_sites}
the_call <-  quote(gamm(ClassCDO ~ 0 + Site + s(year_f, bs = 're'),
                      correlation = corCAR1(form = ~ sdate | Site),
                      family = 'binomial',
                      niterPQL = 20, verbosePQL = TRUE,
                      data = exceeds_two))
do_gamm_two_site$gam$call <- the_call

(my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(do_gamm_two_site, cov.reduce = median)) 
(a <- summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ Site, type = 'response')))
```
