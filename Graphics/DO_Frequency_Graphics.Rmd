# Introduction
The Long Creek Watershed, almost three and a half square miles in area, is
dominated by commercial land use. The Maine Mall is one of the largest land
owners in the watershed, and it is surrounded by a range of commercial
businesses, from medical offices, to car washes.  About a third of the watershed
in impervious surfaces like roads, parking lots, and rooftops.

Landowners with an acre or more of impervious area are required to get a Clean
Water Act permit for stormwater discharges from their property.  The LCWMD
provides an alternative for landowners to working to receive an individual
permit. Landowners who elect to participate in the The Long Creek Watershed
Management District receive a General Permit, in return for providing funding to
the District, and facilitating the work of the district by permitting access to
their property for certain activities.

For more information on LCWMD, see [their web site](restorelongcreek.org).

# This Notebook
This notebook produces graphics depicting the PROBABILITY of meeting or failing
to meet Class C DO standards at each Long Creek Monitoring location.

The core challenge is that we have a limited number of years of data, and data
from some sites is only available for a limited period of years.

We focus on the summer months of July and August, because seasonal variation in
probability of meeting DO standards is very large, and low probability of
failing DO standards at other times of yer interfere with efficient estimation.

## Note
In this data set a "TRUE" value consistently implies that water quality criteria
were met or exceeded, whether that is achieved by a value higher than or lower
than some numeric criteria.  "TRUE" implies good conditions.  "FALSE" implies 
bad conditions.
    
## Sources of Threshold Values  
### Dissolved oxygen
Maineâ€™s Class B water quality standards call for dissolved oxygen above 7 mg/l,
with percent saturation above 75%. The Class C Standards, which apply to almost
all of Long Creek, call for dissolved oxygen above 5 mg/l, with percent
saturation above 60%. In addition, for class C conditions, the thirty day
average dissolved oxygen must stay above 6.5 mg/l.

# Data Preparation
## Folder References
```{r folders}
sibfldnm    <- 'Derived_Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'models'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Data on Sites and Impervious Cover
These data were derived from Table 2 from a GZA report to the Long Creek
Watershed Management District, titled "Re: Long Creek Watershed Data Analysis;
Task 2: Preparation of Explanatory and Other Variables."  The Memo is dated
November 13, 2019 File No. 09.0025977.02.

Cumulative Area and IC calculations are our own, based on the GZA data and the
geometry of the stream channel.

```{r IC_data}
# Read in data and drop the East Branch, where we have no data
fn <- "Site_IC_Data.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

Site_IC_Data <- read_csv(fpath) %>%
  filter(Site != "--") 

# Now, create a factor that preserves the order of rows (roughly upstream to downstream). 
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels = Site_IC_Data$Site))

# Finally, convert percent covers to numeric values
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(CumPctIC = as.numeric(substr(CumPctIC, 1, nchar(CumPctIC)-1))) %>%
  mutate(PctIC = as.numeric(substr(PctIC, 1, nchar(PctIC)-1)))
Site_IC_Data
```

## Main Data
We remove 2019 data, as we don't have a complete year's worth of data, which may
bias annual summaries.

Note that this data does NOT include all of the predictors used in some models
looking at chlorides. In particular, it does not include stream flow estimates 
```{r main_data}
fn <- "Exceeds_Data.csv"
exceeds = read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn), progress=FALSE) %>%
  mutate(IC=Site_IC_Data$CumPctIC[match(Site, Site_IC_Data$Site)]) %>%
  select(-X1) %>%
  filter(Year < 2019) %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels=levels(Site_IC_Data$Site)),
         year_f = factor(Year),
         month_f = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(sdate, format = '%j')),
         season = cut(Month, breaks = c(0,2,5,8,11,13),
                      labels = c('Winter', 'Spring',
                                 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter')),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Winter', 'Spring', 
                                           'Summer', 'Fall'))) %>%
  mutate(lPrecip = log1p(Precip))
```

## Data Corrections
### Anomolous Depth Values
Several depth observations in the record appear highly unlikely. In particular,
several observations show daily median water depths over 15 meters. A few other
observations show daily median depths over 4 meters, which also looks unlikely
in a stream of this size.  All these events also occurred in May or June of 2015
at site S05. Some sort of malfunction of the pressure transducer appears likely.

We can trace these observations back to the raw QA/QC'd pressure and sonde data 
submitted to LCWMD by GZA, so they are not an artifact of our data preparation.

We remove these extreme values.  The other daily medians in May and June of 2015
appear reasonable, and we leave them in place, although given possible 
instability of the pressure sensors, it might make sense to remove them all.

Note that removing depth observations from Site S05  will remove those DATES
from any model that uses the `FlowIndex` variable (see below) as a predictor.
```{r correct_depth_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(D_Median = if_else(D_Median > 4, NA_real_, D_Median),
         lD_Median = log1p(D_Median))
```

### Single S06B Chloride Observation from 2017
The data includes just a single chloride observation from site S06B from
any year other than 2013.  While we do not know if the data point is legitimate
or not, it has  high leverage in several models, and we suspect a 
transcription error of some sort.

We remove the Chloride value from the data.
```{r correct_chloride_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(ChlCCC = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA, ChlCCC),
         ChlCMC = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA, ChlCMC))
```


### Anomolous Dissolved Oxygen and Chloride Values
#### Site S03, end of 2016
We noted  extreme dissolved oxygen data at the end of 2016.  Values were
both extreme and highly variable.  (See discussion in the DO Analysis workbooks).

We decide we should remove chloride and oxygen observations after October 15th.

```{r correct_S03_October_2016_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>% 
  mutate(ChlCCC = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ChlCCC),
         ChlCMC = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ChlCMC),
         ClassCDO = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassCDO),
         ClassBDO = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassBDO),
         ClassC_PctSat = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassC_PctSat),
         ClassB_PctSat = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassB_PctSat),
         ClassCBoth = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassCBoth),
         ClassBBoth = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA, ClassBBoth))
```

## Remove Partial Data from Winter Months
We have very limited data from several months.  We have January data 
from only one year, and February data from only two, and December data from only
four years, all older.  Both March and November sample sizes vary.

The limited winter data generates severely unbalanced samples, which may lead to estimation problems, especially in models with crossed or potentially crossed
factors and predictors.  More fundamentally, the potential bias introduced by
showing data from those months from just a handful of years could give a
misleading impression of seasonal patterns.  We trim December, January and
February data, but leave the other months. 

It is important to remember,  even after trimming the data, that:  
1.  2010 is a partial year,  
2.  The period of sampling in March may be biased due to spring melt timing.

```{r month_by_year_crosstab}
xtabs(~ year_f + month_f, data = exceeds)
```

```{r remove_limited_winter_data}
exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  filter(Month >= 3 & Month <= 11)
```

## Add Stream Flow Index
We worked through many models on a site by site basis in which we included data
on water depth, but since the depth coordinate is site-specific, a 10 cm depth
at one site may be exceptional, while at another it is commonplace. We generally
want not a local measure of stream depth, but a watershed-wide metric of high,
medium, or low stream flow.

Middle and Lower Main Stem sites would be suitable for a general flow indicator
across the watershed. The monitoring sites in that stretch of Long Creek include
include S05 and S17, however only site S05 has been in continuous operation
throughout the period of record, so we use depth data from S05 to construct
our general stream flow indicator.

Stream flow at S05 is correlated with flow at other sites, although not all that
closely correlated to flow in the downstream tributaries (S01 and S03).
```{r depth_correlations}
exceeds %>%
  select(sdate, Site, lD_Median) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Site, values_from = lD_Median) %>%
  select( -sdate) %>%
  cor(use = 'pairwise', method = 'pearson')

```
We use the log of the daily median flow at S05 as a general watershed-wide
stream flow indicator, which we call `FlowIndex`.  We use the log of the raw
median, to lessen the effect of the highly skewed distribution of stream depths
on the metric. The resulting index is still highly skewed.

```{r FlowIndex}
depth_data <- exceeds %>%
  filter (Site == 'S05') %>%
  select(sdate, lD_Median)

exceeds <- exceeds %>%
  mutate(FlowIndex = depth_data$lD_Median[match(sdate, depth_data$sdate)])

rm(depth_data)
```

## Create July and August Data Only
```{r filter_July_August}
exceeds_two <- exceeds %>%
  filter(Month  > 6 & Month < 9)
rm(exceeds)
```

# Graphics of Observed Relative Frequencies
## Site by Year
```{r calc_observed}
rel_freq <- exceeds_two %>%
  group_by(Year, Site) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(! is.na(ClassCDO)),
            n_pass = sum(ClassCDO, na.rm = TRUE),
            n_fail = n - n_pass,
            p = n_pass / n,
            q = n_fail / n,
            v_p =p*q/n,
            sd_p = sqrt(v_p),
            .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r plot_observed, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(rel_freq, aes(Year, p, color = Site)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.25) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = p-sd_p, ymax = p + sd_p)) +

  ylab('Summer Proportion Exceeding\nClass C DO Standard') +
  xlab('')

```

## Site Only
```{r calc_observed_sites}
rel_freq <- exceeds_two %>%
  group_by(Site) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(! is.na(ClassCDO)),
            n_pass = sum(ClassCDO, na.rm = TRUE),
            n_fail = n - n_pass,
            p = n_pass / n,
            q = n_fail / n,
            v_p =p*q/n,
            sd_p = sqrt(v_p),
            .groups = 'drop')
rel_freq
```

### Observed Graphic
We start with a graphic based only on teh observed relative frequencies. But
the problem is that the years is which we have actual data vary site by site, so
the comparison is not really fair. Also, teh standard errors offered here are
much too narrow, since observations are correlated.
```{r plot_observed_sites, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(rel_freq, aes(Site, p)) +
  #geom_point(size = 2, color = cbep_colors()[4]) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = p-1.96*sd_p, ymax = p + 1.96*sd_p), 
                  color = cbep_colors()[5],
                  size = .75) +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()) +
  ylab('Proportion of Summer Days Meeting\nClass C DO Standard') +
  xlab('Upstream          Main Stem         Downstream') +
  ylim(0,1) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)

ggsave('figures/do_observed_exceed_summer_site_only.pdf', device = cairo_pdf, width = 7, height = 5)

```

### Model based Graphics
This generates a graphic with more honest error bars, because it properly 
incorporates autocorrelation and year to year variation.

#### Model Development
```{r do_gamm_site, cache = TRUE}
do_gamm_two_site<- gamm(ClassCDO ~ 0 + Site + s(year_f, bs = 're'),

                      family = 'binomial',
                      niterPQL = 20, verbosePQL = TRUE,
                      data = exceeds_two)
```

```{r}
