# Introduction
This R Notebook explores various models for analyzing dissolved oxygen levels in 
Long Creek. 

We develop a graphic to contrast raw data, simple means, and weather-corrected 
marginal means for understanding dissolved oxygen in Long Creek.

## Weather-Corrected Marginal Means
We use a (relatively) simple GAM model, developed in the "DO Analysis.rmd" 
notebook to provide the temperature corrected marginal means.  While we examined
significantly more complex models, marginal means differed little, and we prefer
model simplicity for the sake of communication to State of Casco Bay audiences.

We use a model of the form:

$$ Oxygen = f(Covariates) + g(Predictors) + Error$$

Where:
*  Site-independent stream flow,a nd site-specific water temperature 
   covariates enter into the model either via linear functions or spline
   smoothers. Predictors include:
   -- natural log of the depth of water (in meters) at Site S05, in 
      mid-watershed, and 
   -- the local daily median water temperature at each monitoring Site.
   
*  The predictors enter the model via linear functions of:  
   --  site,  
   --  year,  
   --  time of year (Month in the models we consider here)
   
* The error includes both  *i.i.d* normal error and an AR(1) autocorrelated 
  error.

# Data Preparation
## Initial Folder References
```{r folders}
sibfldnm    <- 'Original_Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'models'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Load Weather Data
```{r load_weather_data}
fn <- "Portland_Jetport_2009-2019.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

weather_data <- read_csv(fpath, 
 col_types = cols(.default = col_skip(),
        date = col_date(),
        PRCP = col_number(), PRCPattr = col_character() #,
        #SNOW = col_number(), SNOWattr = col_character(), 
        #TMIN = col_number(), TMINattr = col_character(), 
        #TAVG = col_number(), TAVGattr = col_character(), 
        #TMAX = col_number(), TMAXattr = col_character(), 
        )) %>%
  rename(sdate = date) %>%
  mutate(pPRCP = dplyr::lag(PRCP))
```

## Update Folder References
```{r folders_update}
sibfldnm    <- 'Derived_Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
```

## Load Data on Sites and Impervious Cover
These data were derived from Table 2 from a GZA report to the Long Creek
Watershed Management District, titled "Re: Long Creek Watershed Data Analysis;
Task 2: Preparation of Explanatory and Other Variables."  The Memo is dated
November 13, 2019 File No. 09.0025977.02.

Cumulative Area and IC calculations are our own, based on the GZA data and the
geometry of the stream channel.

```{r imperviousness}
# Read in data and drop the East Branch, where we have no data
fn <- "Site_IC_Data.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

Site_IC_Data <- read_csv(fpath) %>%
  filter(Site != "--") 

# Now, create a factor that preserves the order of rows (roughly upstream to downstream). 
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels = Site_IC_Data$Site))

# Finally, convert percent covers to numeric values
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(CumPctIC = as.numeric(substr(CumPctIC, 1, nchar(CumPctIC)-1))) %>%
  mutate(PctIC = as.numeric(substr(PctIC, 1, nchar(PctIC)-1)))
Site_IC_Data
```

## Load Main Data
Read in the data from the Derived Data folder.

Note that I filter out data from 2019 because that is only a partial year, which might affect estimation of things like seasonal trends.  We could add it back in, but with care....

*Full_Data.csv* does not include a field for precipitation from the
previous day.  In earlier work, we learned that a weighted sum of recent
precipitation provided better explanatory power.  But we also want to check
a simpler model, so we construct a "PPrecip" data field.  This is based
on a modification of code in the "Make_Daily_Summaries.Rmd" notebook.

```{r}
fn <- "Full_Data.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

full_data <- read_csv(fpath, 
    col_types = cols(DOY = col_integer(), 
        D_Median = col_double(), Precip = col_number(), 
        X1 = col_skip(), Year = col_integer(), 
        FlowIndex = col_double())) %>%

  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels=levels(Site_IC_Data$Site))) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = month.abb)) %>%
  mutate(IC=as.numeric(Site_IC_Data$CumPctIC[match(Site, Site_IC_Data$Site)])) %>%
  mutate(Year_f = factor(Year)) %>%

# We combine data using "match" because we have data for multiple sites and 
# therefore dates are not unique.  `match()` correctly assigns weather
# data by date.
mutate(PPrecip = weather_data$pPRCP[match(sdate, weather_data$sdate)])

```

### Cleanup
```{r}
rm(Site_IC_Data, weather_data)
rm(fn, fpath, parent, sibling, sibfldnm)
```

## Data Correction

### Anomolous Depth Values
Several depth observations in the record appear highly unlikely. In particular,
several observations show daily median water depths over 15 meters. And
those observations were recorded in May or June, at site S05, with no associated 
record of significant precipitation, and no elevated depths at other sites on 
the stream.

We can trace these observations back to the raw QA/QC'd pressure and sonde data 
submitted to LCWMD by GZA, so they are not an artifact of our data preparation.

A few more observations show daily median depths over 4 meters, which also
looks unlikely in a stream of this size.  All these events also occurred in 
May or June of 2015 at site S05. Some sort of malfunction of the pressure 
transducer appears likely.

We remove these extreme values.  The other daily medians in May and June of 2015
appear reasonable, and we leave them in place, although given possible 
instability of the pressure sensors, it might make sense to remove them all.
```{r}
full_data <- full_data %>%
  mutate(D_Median = if_else(D_Median > 4, NA_real_, D_Median),
         lD_Median = if_else(D_Median > 4, NA_real_, lD_Median))
```

### Single S06B Chloride Observation from 2017
The data includes just a single chloride observation from site S06B from
any year other than 2013.  While we do not know if the data point is legitimate
or not, it has very high leverage in several models, and we suspect a 
transcription error of some sort.
```{r Show_bad_datum, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
full_data %>%
  filter(Site == 'S06B') %>%
  select(sdate, DO_Median) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sdate, y = DO_Median)) + geom_point()
```

We remove the Chloride value from the data.
```{r}
full_data <- full_data %>%
  mutate(DO_Median = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA_real_, DO_Median))
```

### Site S03, end of 2016
We noted some extreme dissolved oxygen data at the end of 2016.  Values were
both extreme and highly variable.

We decided we should remove chloride and oxygen observations after October 15th.

```{r}
full_data <- full_data %>% 
  mutate(DO_Median = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA_real_, DO_Median),
         DO_Median = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA_real_, DO_Median),
         PctSat_Median = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA_real_, PctSat_Median))
```

## Remove Partial Data from Winter Months
We have very limited data from several months.  We have January data 
from only one year, and February data from only three, and December data from 
four, all older.  Both March and November sample sizes vary.

The limited winter data generates severely unbalanced samples, which may lead to
estimation problems, especially in models with crossed or potentially crossed
factors and predictors.  More fundamentally, the potential bias introduced by
showing data from those months from just a handful of years could give a
misleading impression of seasonal patterns.  We trim December, January and
February data, but leave the other months.

It is important to remember,  even after trimming the data, that:  
1.  2010 is a partial year,  
2.  The period of sampling in March may be biased due to spring melt timing.

```{r month_by_year_crosstab}
xtabs(~ Year_f + Month, data = full_data)
```

```{r remove_limited_winter_data}
full_data <- full_data %>%
  filter(Month %in% month.abb[3:11]  )
```

## Add Stream Flow Index
We worked through many models on a site by site basis in which we included data
on water depth, but since the depth coordinate is site-specific, a 10 cm depth
at one site may be exceptional, while at another it is commonplace. We generally
want not a local measure of stream depth, but a watershed-wide metric of high,
medium, or low stream flow.

Middle and Lower Maine Stem sites would be suitable for a general flow indicator
across the watershed. The monitoring sites in that stretch of Long Creek include
include S05 and S17, however only site S05 has been in continuous operation
throughout the period of record, so we use depth data from S05 to construct
our general stream flow indicator.

Stream flow at S05 is correlated with flow at other sites, although not all that
closely correlated to flow in the downstream tributaries.

```{r}
full_data %>%
  select(sdate, Site, lD_Median) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Site, values_from = lD_Median) %>%
  select( -sdate) %>%
  cor(use = 'pairwise', method = 'pearson')

```

We use the log of the daily median flow at S05 as a general watershed-wide
stream flow indicator, which we call `FlowIndex`.  We use the log of the raw
median, to lessen the effect of the highly skewed distribution of stream depths
on the metric.

```{r}
depth_data <- full_data %>%
  filter (Site == 'S05') %>%
  select(sdate, lD_Median)

full_data <- full_data %>%
  mutate(FlowIndex = depth_data$lD_Median[match(sdate, depth_data$sdate)])
  rm(depth_data)
```

Note that because the flow record at S05 has some gaps, any model using this
predictor is likely to have a smaller sample size.

# Initial GAMM Model
This model is likely to take approximately 15 minutes to run.
```{r first_gamm, cache = TRUE}
if (! file.exists("models/do_gamm.rds")) {
  print(
    system.time(
      do_gamm <- gamm(DO_Median ~ Site + 
                        T_Median +
                        s(FlowIndex) +
                        Month +
                        Year_f,
                       correlation = corAR1(form = ~ as.numeric(sdate) | Site),
                       na.action = na.omit, 
                       method = 'REML',
                       data = full_data)
    )
  )
  saveRDS(do_gamm, file="models/do_gamm.rds")
} else {
  do_gamm <- readRDS("models/do_gamm.rds")
}
```

# Simplified GAMM Model
Our simplified GAMM only fits a soothing term for water temperature.  This is a 
simplification, as other models demonstrate that more complex models perform
better by several standard model metrics.  However, this one is simple to
explain.  And (with one exception) choice of model has little effect on our
qualitative conclusions.  See the "DO_Analysis_Summary.Rmd" file for details.

This model takes several minutes to run (more than 5, less than 15)
We check for a saved version before recalculating. If you alter underlying
data or model, you need to delete the saved version of the model to trigger 
recalculation.
```{r second_gamm, cache = TRUE}
if (! file.exists("models/do_gamm_2.rds")) {
  print(
    system.time(
      do_gamm_2<- gamm(DO_Median ~ Site + 
                        s(T_Median, k = 1) +
                        Year_f,
                       correlation = corAR1(form = ~ as.numeric(sdate) | Site),
                       na.action = na.omit, 
                       method = 'REML',
                       data = full_data)
    )
  )
  saveRDS(do_gamm_2, file="models/do_gamm_2.rds")
} else {
  do_gamm_2 <- readRDS("models/do_gamm_2.rds")
}
```

## Visualizing Estimated Marginal Means
Reliably calling `emmeans()` for `gamm()` models requires creating a call object 
and associating it with the model as `do_gamm_2$gam$call`. (See the `emmeans` 
"models" vignette for more info. We (re)create the call object, associate it 
with the model, manually construct a  reference grid before finally calling 
`emmeans()` to extract marginal means.

We use `cov.reduce = median` to override the 
default behavior of `emmeans()` and `ref_grid()`, which set quantitative 
covariates at their mean values.  Because of the  highly skewed nature of  
of our predictors, the median provides a more realistic set of "typical" values 
for the covariates, making the estimates marginal means more relevant.

It is worth pointing out that marginal means may not be the most useful way 
to summarize these models, as our interest lies in extremes, which occur during
high temperature or low flow events, at our shallowwater sites.  Teh marginal 
means blend across those categories.

```{r create_call_objects}
the_call <-  quote(gamm(DO_Median ~ Site + 
                        T_Median +
                        s(FlowIndex) +
                        Month +
                        Year_f,
                       correlation = corAR1(form = ~ as.numeric(sdate) | Site),
                       na.action = na.omit, 
                       method = 'REML',
                       data = full_data))
do_gamm$gam$call <- the_call




the_call <-  quote(gamm(DO_Median ~ Site + 
                        s(T_Median, k = 1) +
                        Year_f,
                       correlation = corAR1(form = ~ as.numeric(sdate) | Site),
                       na.action = na.omit, 
                       method = 'REML',
